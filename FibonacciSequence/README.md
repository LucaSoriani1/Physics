# Fibonacci Sequence and Golden Ratio Calculator
This script calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given length, then calculates the ratio between the last two numbers in the sequence, and compares it with the golden ratio.

### Introduction
The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci sequence is found in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the spiral of shells, and the branching of trees.

The golden ratio, also known as the divine proportion, is a mathematical ratio that is approximately equal to 1.61803398875. It is found in nature, art, and architecture, and is often associated with beauty and harmony.

The relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio is that the ratio of any two consecutive numbers in the sequence approaches the golden ratio as the sequence goes to infinity. In other words, the larger the numbers in the sequence, the closer the ratio between them is to the golden ratio.

### Requirements
This script requires Python 3 and the math module, which is included in the standard library.

### Usage
To use the script, run the following command:

```
python fibonacci.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the length of the Fibonacci sequence you wish to calculate. After entering the value, the script will print the first n numbers of the sequence and the ratio between the last two numbers.

Finally, the script will print the value of the golden ratio and the difference between the ratio of the last two Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio.

### Modifications and Contributions
