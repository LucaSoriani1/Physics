# Prime numbers generator
This code defines two functions to generate and check prime numbers. Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. They play a crucial role in number theory and have applications in various fields like cryptography, computer science, and physics. However, finding prime numbers can be a challenging task, especially for large numbers.

The complexity of generating prime numbers is considered to be O(n * sqrt(n)), which means that the time taken to generate primes increases with the size of n. For a given number n, we only need to check its divisibility up to the square root of n because any factor of a number must be less than or equal to its square root. As the value of n increases, the number of iterations required to check if a number is prime increases, leading to longer execution times.

The main function generates the first 40000 prime numbers and calculates the time taken to do so. The code uses a simple approach to generate prime numbers by iterating through all numbers from 2 and checking if they are prime using the is_prime() function. Prime numbers are added to the list of primes until the list contains the required number of primes.

### Functions
* is_prime(n)
This function takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is a prime number, and False otherwise. It checks divisibility of n up to the square root of n, as any factor of a number must be less than or equal to its square root.

* prime_numbers(count)
This function takes an integer count as input and generates a list of the first 'count' prime numbers using the is_prime() function.

### Execution
To run the code, you need to call the main() function, which generates the first 40000 prime numbers and calculates the time taken to do so. The list of primes and the execution time are printed to the console.

Note that the time taken to generate prime numbers can be significant, especially for large numbers. The complexity of generating prime numbers is considered to be O(n * sqrt(n)), which means that the time taken to generate primes increases with the size of n.


### Usage
To use the script, run the following command:

```
python prime.py
```

The script will print the first n=4000 prime numbers by default and the time spent for the execution.
