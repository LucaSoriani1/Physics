# Random Trajectories
Random trajectories refer to paths or movements that are unpredictable or irregular. They are characterized by a lack of a clear pattern or direction, and they can be influenced by various random factors or events. Random trajectories can be observed in various fields, such as physics, biology, finance, and computer science, and they are often modeled using stochastic processes or probability distributions. Examples of random trajectories include the movements of particles in a gas, the growth patterns of bacterial colonies, the fluctuations in stock prices, or the behavior of users on a website.

In this program, we generate and plot multiple random trajectories  by randomly choosing the direction of movement (left or right) at each step.
We then plot these trajectories using the Matplotlib library.

We then define the list of possible movements and the maximum number of steps for each trajectory. Next, we generate n_trajs random trajectories by randomly choosing a direction to move at each step. Finally, we plot the trajectories using Matplotlib.

The program provides a simple example of how to generate and plot random trajectories. 

### Usage
To run the program, open the terminal and type the following command:
```
python random_trajectories.py
```
Five random trajectories will be generated and plotted.

### Dependencies
The program requires the installation of the following Python libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy

The libraries can be installed using pip, for example:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The default values for NUM_TRAJECTORIES and MAX_STEP are 5 and 90000, respectively. You can change these values in the main function.

### Modifications and Contributions
This program can be extended and modified to suit different purposes, such as modeling natural processes or generating random data for testing purposes. If you would like to contribute to the program or propose modifications, please send a pull request or contact the author.
